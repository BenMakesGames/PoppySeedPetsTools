# PoppySeedPetsTools

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Running PoppySeedPetsTools

In the future, I may package PoppySeedPetsTools up into a nice, stand-alone program. For now, however, you'll need to install npm and Angular in order to run it.

The following instructions are intended for a Windows or Mac user who is NOT a developer. You will need to run a couple command line instructions.

1. **Install Node and npm.** You can download an installer for them here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. **Install Angular.** Open up a command prompt anywhere, and run `npm install -g @angular/cli` (If you're wondering what this weird command I'm asking you to run is, you can learn more about Angular here: https://angular.io/cli)
3. **Download PoppySeedPetsTools.** Click the "Clone or download" button above, and choose "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP somewhere on your computer. (Or, if you're familiar with git, you use that, and you don't need to me tell you how :P)
  * Confirm that you know where you put everything :P Open the PoppySeedPetsTools project folder; if you can see files called things like ".gitignore", "angular.json", etc, then you're in the right place.
4. **Run PoppySeedPetsTools.** Open a command prompt in the PoppySeedPetsTools project folder, and run `ng serve`. In your browser, visit http://localhost:4200
